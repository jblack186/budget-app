## Description
### The Problem 
Most average bank users are not very good at budgeting. They typically don't understand best practices for basic monthly spending. Furthermore their banking portal doesn't easily categorize purchases in to more identifiable spending habits.

### The Solution
TBG uses Plaid's API access to nearly any major banking institution to analyze annual income, break down existing spending habits at the time of sign up, and help users correct to more a sustainable monthly breakdown to reach goals and better financial literacy.
